The JVM is abbreviated as Java Virtual Machine. And it is repsonbile to generate the java byte code.The main components of the JVM are:

ClassLoader: Loads Java class files into memory through three phases: loading, linking (verification, preparation, resolution), and initialization.

Runtime Data Area: Divided into the method area (stores class-level data), heap (stores objects dynamically allocated), Java stacks (per-thread stack for method invocations), PC registers (program counter registers), and native method stacks.

Execution Engine: Executes Java bytecode, using techniques like interpretation and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for performance optimization.

Native Method Interface (JNI): Enables interaction between Java programs and native code written in other languages like C or C++.

Java Native Library: Provides platform-specific JVM implementation and interfaces with the underlying operating system.
