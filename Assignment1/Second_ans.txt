JDK, JRE, and JVM are all key components of the Java programming language. Here's the difference between them:

JDK (Java Development Kit):

The JDK is a software development kit that provides the necessary tools, libraries, and documentation for developing Java applications.
It includes the Java compiler (javac) for compiling Java source code into bytecode, as well as other development tools like debuggers and profilers.
The JDK also includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) as a subset, allowing developers to run their Java applications during the development process.
In addition to the development tools, the JDK also includes libraries and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that developers can use to build Java applications.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment):

The JRE is an environment that provides the necessary runtime support for executing Java applications.
It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), libraries, and other components required to run Java applications.
The JRE does not include development tools like compilers or debuggers, making it suitable for end-users who only need to run Java applications.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

The JVM is an abstract machine that executes Java bytecode.
It is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and translating it into machine code that can be understood and executed by the underlying operating system.
The JVM provides platform independence by allowing Java programs to run on any system that has a compatible JVM installed.
It manages memory, performs garbage collection, and provides other runtime services required by Java applications.
