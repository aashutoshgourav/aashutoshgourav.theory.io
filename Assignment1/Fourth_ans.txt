JIT stands for Just-In-Time. A JIT compiler is a component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that dynamically compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime, allowing for improved performance during program execution. 
When a Java program is executed, the JVM initially interprets the bytecode line by line.
However, when the JVM identifies certain code sections that are frequently executed or deemed performance-critical, it triggers the JIT compiler.
The JIT compiler dynamically compiles the identified bytecode sections into machine code, specific to the underlying hardware and operating system.
This compilation happens during runtime, just before the execution of the corresponding code.
The JIT compiler performs various optimization techniques on the compiled code to improve execution speed.
These optimizations include removing redundant code, inlining methods, eliminating unnecessary checks, and optimizing memory access.
Once the JIT compiler compiles a section of bytecode into machine code, it caches the compiled code for future use.
This caching mechanism avoids recompiling the same code section every time it is encountered during program execution.
JIT compilers often employ adaptive techniques to monitor and analyze program behavior during runtime.
Based on the observed runtime characteristics, the JIT compiler may recompile certain code sections with different optimization strategies to further enhance performance.
JIT compilation introduces a slight overhead during the initial execution as bytecode needs to be interpreted.
However, as the JIT compiler optimizes and compiles frequently executed code, subsequent executions of those code sections are much faster.
The trade-off lies in the increased startup time in exchange for improved overall performance during program execution.
