Java provides several built-in data types that programmers can use to declare variables and manipulate data. The main data types in Java:

Primitive Data Types:

boolean: Represents a boolean value (true or false).
byte: Represents a signed 8-bit integer value.
short: Represents a signed 16-bit integer value.
int: Represents a signed 32-bit integer value.
long: Represents a signed 64-bit integer value.
float: Represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point value.
double: Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point value.
char: Represents a single Unicode character.
Reference Data Types:

String: Represents a sequence of characters.
Arrays: Represents a collection of elements of the same type.
Classes: Represents user-defined types.
Derived Data Types:

Enums: Represents a set of predefined values.
Interfaces: Represents a contract for classes to implement.
Special Types:

void: Represents the absence of a type. Used for methods that do not return a value.
