Interpreter:

Translates and executes the source code line by line during runtime.
Does not generate an independent executable file.
Slower execution speed compared to compilers.
Detects errors line by line during execution.
More portable as the interpreter itself handles the execution.
Lower memory usage as it only stores the intermediate representation and the currently executed line.
Compiler:

Translates the entire source code into machine code before execution.
Generates an independent executable file.
Faster execution speed compared to interpreters.
Detects errors during the compilation process.
Platform-specific, requiring recompilation for different platforms.
Often requires more memory due to generating machine code for the entire program
