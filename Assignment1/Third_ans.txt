The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) allocates memory for various purposes during the execution of a Java program. There are several memory areas or regions managed by the JVM. The main memory areas allocated by the JVM are as follows:

Heap Memory:

The Heap memory is the runtime data area where objects are allocated.
It is shared among all threads and dynamically grows and shrinks based on the requirements of the program.
The objects in the heap are managed by the garbage collector, which automatically frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced.
Stack Memory:

Each thread in a Java program has its own stack memory.
The stack memory is used to store local variables, method invocations, and method call stack.
It operates in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner and is automatically managed by the JVM.
Method Area (or PermGen):

The Method Area stores class structures, method bytecode, constant pool, and static variables.
It is shared among all threads and is a part of the JVM's memory reserved for the execution of the program.
Starting from Java 8, the Permanent Generation (PermGen) was replaced by the Metaspace, which is a native memory area outside of the JVM heap.
Program Counter (PC) Register:

Each thread in the JVM has its own Program Counter (PC) Register.
The PC Register stores the address of the currently executing instruction of the thread.
It is updated as the thread executes each instruction and helps in maintaining the program flow.
Native Method Stacks:

Native method stacks are used to execute native methods or methods written in other languages.
They are separate from the JVM's Java stack and are specific to native code execution
