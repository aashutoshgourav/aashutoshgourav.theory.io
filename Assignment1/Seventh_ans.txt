In Java, variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated and accessed throughout a program. Java supports different types of variables, each with its own characteristics and usage. Here are the main types of variables in Java:

Primitive Variables: These variables hold simple, fundamental data types. Java provides eight primitive data types:
boolean: Represents a true/false value.
byte: Represents a small integer value.
short: Represents a short integer value.
int: Represents an integer value.
long: Represents a long integer value.
float: Represents a single-precision floating-point value.
double: Represents a double-precision floating-point value.
char: Represents a single character.

Object Variables: These variables hold references to objects or instances of classes. Object variables are declared using a class name and can store the memory address of an object.
Ex: String name = "Aashutosh"; Here, name is an object variable of type String.

Array Variables: Arrays are objects in Java, and array variables store references to arrays. They can hold multiple values of the same type.
Ex: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; Here, numbers is an array variable of type int[].

Static Variables: These variables are associated with a class rather than an instance of the class. They are shared among all instances of the class and are accessed using the class name.
Static variables are declared using the static keyword and can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
Ex: static int count = 0; Here, count is a static variable.

Instance Variables: These variables are declared inside a class but outside any method or constructor. Each instance of a class has its own copy of instance variables.
Instance variables are declared without the static keyword and are accessed using object references.
Ex: public int age; Here, age is an instance variable.

Local Variables: These variables are declared within a method, constructor, or block and are accessible only within their scope,local variables must be initialized before they are used.
For example: int x = 10; Here, x is a local variable.
